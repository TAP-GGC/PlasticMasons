## Teaching 3D Modeling via an Engaging TinkerCAD Project

Description:
As a group, we created a workshop to teach audiences of various ages how to use 3D modeling technology on behalf of the Tech 
Ambassador Program at Georgia Gwinnett College. The Tech Ambassador Program (TAP) is a successful outreach program started  
over 10 years ago at Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) aiming to to attract students to Information Technology and STEM.

In our workshop, we walked our audience through the recreation of the Death Star from Star Wars, choosing it for its combination of simplicity
to make and its cultural impact and recognizability.
