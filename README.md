# Teaching 3D Modeling via an Engaging TinkerCAD Project

# Description:    
As a group, we created a workshop to teach audiences of various ages how to use 3D modeling technology on behalf of the Tech Ambassador Program at Georgia Gwinnett College. The Tech Ambassador Program (TAP) is a successful outreach program started over 10 years ago at Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) aiming to to attract students to Information Technology and STEM. [TAP Website](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program)     
In our workshop, we walked our audience through the recreation of the Death Star from Star Wars, choosing it for its combination of simplicity to make and its cultural impact and recognizability.

# Outreach Activities    
1. Super Saturday Series (S3), Oct 28th, 2023, GGC – middle school girls to promote IT and STEM    
2. Tap Expo, Oct 10, 2023 – The TAP expo is an opportunity to present IT to students at Georgia Gwinnett College that may not have been exposed to tech.      
3. Teaching 3D Modeling via an Engaging TinkerCAD Project, Peter Davis, Ato Koomson, Huyen Pham, CCSC: SE conference - on Nov 3rd and 4th, 2023, we presented at the CCSC:SE student research contest at Coastal Carolina University.    
4. Class Workshops – on [Oct 25th, Nov 13th, and Nov 17th] 3 occasions, to promote the IT field to a mix of IT and non-IT college students.  
     
# Technology  
In our project, we use TinkerCAD, which is a user-friendly, web-based 3D modeling software accessible through a standard web browser. Additionally, we employ 3D printers to bring digital designs to life.  
TinkerCAD provides an excellent platform for beginners to grasp the fundamentals of 3D modeling because it eliminates some of the common pain points associated with 3D modeling software.

# Project setup / Installation
  
- Step 1:  Create a free personal account on Tinkercad    
- Step 2:  Press the Create button to start creating a new 3D design    
- Step 3: Start exploring the TinkerCAD interface    

# Usage

[To Build The Death Star:](./documents/TinkerCADDeathStarTutorial)      
- Step 1: Drag and drop a sphere into the workplane    
- Step 2: Drag and drop a tube into the workplane next to the sphere    
- Step 3: Use the handle at the top of the tube to open a dialogue box and enter "0.5" to specify a height of half a millimeter    
- Step 4: Drag the tube so that it's directly under the sphere    
- Step 5: Use the cone floating above the tube to elevate it to the middle of the sphere    
- Step 6: Check alignment and adjust as necessary    
- Step 7: Select "Hole" in the dialogue box near the top right corner of the workspace    
- Step 8: Shift + Click to select both shapes then Ctrl + G to group them    
- Step 9: Drag a second sphere into the workplane and make it a hole    
- Step 10: Align the spheres in a way that the intersection of the shapes forms the laser array on the Death Star    
- Step 11: Group the shapes    
- Step 12 (Optional): Select a color by clicking the circle above "Solid" and choosing whatever color you want.
