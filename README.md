# Teaching 3D Modeling via an Engaging TinkerCAD Project

## :loudspeaker: About

This workshop is designed to teach the fundamentals of 3D modeling by guiding participants through the recreation of the Death Star from Star Wars using Tinkercad. The Death Star was chosen for its balance of visual simplicty and cultural impact, making it accessible to beginniners and instantly recgonizable for many.

## :bulb: Project Information
* <b>Difficulty Level:</b> Beginner
* <b>Target Audience:</b> Middle School - College
* <b>Needed Materials:</b> Computer or laptop with Tinkercad
* <b>Learning Outcomes:</b> To introduce participants to 3D design and 3D printing
* <b>Main Technology</b> Tinkercad, a free web-based, and easy-to-use tool for 3D design
* [Technology Ambassador Program](https://tapggc.org/) <b>(TAP)</b> is a project-based class that provides a collaborative environment for students to work with their fellow classmates on a semester-long project using technologies of their choice. TAP strives to increase participation in IT through numerous outreach activities and workshops that are designed to showcase the creative and fun side of technology.

## :computer: Usage

### Building The Death Star
Access the Death Star tutorial [here](./documents/TinkerCADDeathStarTutorial.pptx).  
1. Drag and drop a sphere onto the workspace
2. Drag and drop a tube onto the workplane next to the sphere
3. Use the handle at the top of the tube to open a dialogue box and enter "0.5" to change the height to half a milimeter
4.  Drag the tube so that is is directly under the shere
5.   Use the cone floating above the tube to elevate it to the middle of the sphere
6.   Check the alignment and adjust as necessary
7.   Select "Hole" in the dialogue box near the top right corner of the workspace
8.   Press Shift + Click to select both shapes, then press Ctrl + G to group them
9.   Drag a second sphere onto the workplane and make it a hole
10.   Align the spheres in a way that the intersection of the shapes form the laser array on the Death Star
11.   Group the shapes
12.   (Optional): Select a color by clicking the circle above "Solid" and choose whatever color you like
